This is your website.\r\n\r\n## Editing: \r\n\r\nTo edit contents, edit the .md file of the page you want to modify:\r\n\r\n- **Home:** home.md\r\n- **Supported Devices:** devices.md\r\n- **Changelog:** changelog.md\r\n- **Downloads:** downloads.md\r\n- **Source:** source.md\r\n- **Secondary Projects:** projects.md\r\n\r\nAll files are formatted using Markdown, although the Supported Devices page uses a bit of HTML to display tables, which are not officially supported by Markdown.\r\n\r\nChanging the layout is possible, but not recommended. If you really want to, **do not** edit the index.htm or style.min.css directly - rather, modify the index.jade (written in the Jade templating language) or style.css, then manually compile the Jade file and minify the CSS. However, it is recommended that you let somebody with some web design experience (I think ShivangDave can do it, and so can I) modify it.\r\n\r\nThat's it, I think.\r\n\r\nNSDCars5.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
