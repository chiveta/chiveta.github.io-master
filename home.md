## Home - TamsuiCM11
Welcome to the TamsuiCM11 wiki, we provide CyanogenMod 11 builds for Sony 2012 devices.

Currently, we support Sony Xperia J (jlo), E (nanhu), Tipo (tapioca) and Miro (mesona). All of these devices share the Qualcomm MSM7627a SoC with 800Mhz/1Ghz cortex-a5 processor, 512MB RAM and 2.5GB of storage. Other features such as display, resolution and sensors vary slightly between devices.

Qualcomm and consequently the Code Aurora Forum (CAF) dropped official support for MSM7627a in June 2013 and is no longer supporting the chipset. Therefore code from AOSP, CAF and CyanogenMod do not support this chipset and even remove legacy code required. Due to these reasons the ROMs we release aren't suitable for daily drivers at this current time, we are trying hard to provide fast, stable builds with all features working. Despite the removal of legacy code, we try to stay close to official CyanogenMod code as far as possible.

**Current status - Beta**

- (30.10.2014) What we are currently working on and issues we are trying to resolve:
  - Fix camera
  - Fix H/W video playback (Artifacts XE)
  - Update kernel to kk-2.7
  - Support dual-SIM devices
